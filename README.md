# Blue Pages – Cardano Real-World Utility Directory

The strictest Cardano project directory in existence.

**Only projects with proven revenue, real users, or government/enterprise adoption are listed.**  
No hype. No memecoins. No vaporware. No exceptions. Ever.

Live site → https://bluepagesada.github.io/Bluepagesada/

### Curation Rules (non-negotiable)
- Must have verifiable on-chain revenue **or** off-chain revenue proof  
- **or** real users on mainnet (not testnet)  
- **or** signed government/enterprise contract (publicly verifiable)  

If it doesn't meet the bar, it doesn't get listed. Period.

### Daily Updates
The site is JSON-driven. Adding/removing a project = one-line edit in `projects.json`.  
No more editing giant HTML files like a caveman.

### Submit a Project
Use the "Submit Project" button on the site → reviewed manually within 48h.

### Donate to Keep It Running
ADA address in footer (QR + copy button). All donations go to server costs and curator time.
